			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>For our project we wanted to apply the techniques of <a class="inline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_pursuit">basis pursuit</a> and <a class="inline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_approximation">sparse approximation</a> to recreate frames of video using linear combinations of other images. Specifically, our goal was to create a sparse representation of scenes from season six of HBO's award-winning fantasy drama series, <i>Game of Thrones</i>, where our basis vectors would be frames taken at regular intervals from season one of HBO's award-winning fantasy drama series, <i>Game of Thrones</i>.</p>

			<h2>Approach</h2>
			<ol>
				<li align="left" style="margin-bottom:1.5em"><p>Select a set of potential basis vectors and resample them to the same size as the target images. We sampled one frame every ten seconds from the first three episodes of season one and resized them to 360x203 pixels. Each of these images was a 203x360x3 matrix (we used color video so each pixel was an RGB triple), but we converted them to vectors of 219,240 elements each. The result was a 219,240x1,049 (the number of training images) matrix <span class="math">T</span>.</p></li>

				<li align="left" style="margin-bottom:1.5em"><p style="margin-bottom:.5em">Choose a sparse basis of <span class="math">k</span> images from the training set that will best represent the target image. Initially, we attempted to calculate the similarity between our target image and our basis images using the sum of squared differences of the pixel values. Doing this calculation on each of our 1,049 training images for every target frame, however, proved to be too time intensive. Furthermore, this approach did not mirror the target images as accurately as we had hoped, most likely due to the fact that our new set of basis images lacked the variance needed to model individual characters in the scene. Instead, the frames tended to contain a similar image color while failing to recreate specific objects.</p>

				<p style="margin-bottom:.5em">Rather than doing SSD, we decided to use the eigenvalues of the image vectors as a way to quickly find the images in our basis with the most variance. This approach allowed us to trim the basis only once, rather than for each target vector, as the variance of our basis images did not depend on the input frame.</p>

				<p>This involves calculating the eigenvalues of <span class="math">T</span> 's covariance matrix. For images of our size, however, this matrix <span class="math">TT<sup>T</sup></span> would have over 10<sup>10</sup> elements, making principle component analysis computationally infeasible. Instead, we notice that the eigenvector decomposition of <span class="math">T</span> 's matrix:
				<div class="equation text-center">
					<span class="math">TT<sup>T</sup>v<sub>i</sub> = &lambda;<sub>i</sub>v<sub>i</sub></span>
				</div>
				can be reformatted as the eigenvalue decomposition of the matrix <span class="math">T<sup>T</sup>T</span>, premultiplied by <span class="math">T</span>:
				<div class="equation text-center">
					<span class="math">TT<sup>T</sup>Tu<sub>i</sub> = &lambda;<sub>i</sub>Tu<sub>i</sub></span>
				</div>
				Thus an eigenvalue <span class="math">&lambda;<sub>i</sub></span> of <span class="math">T<sup>T</sup>T</span> will also be an eigenvalue of the covariance matrix <span class="math">TT<sup>T</sup></span>. This matrix, nicknamed "Tiny Tim", is only 1,049x1,049, so the computation is much more manageable.</li>

				<li align="left" style="margin-bottom:1.5em"><p>Select the best images based on descending eigenvalue to use as a sparse basis.</p></li>

				<li align="left" style="margin-bottom:1.5em"><p>Perform least squares fitting to calculate the weights for each of the chosen basis images. This is done by computing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of <span class="math">D</span>, the matrix of chosen basis image vectors:
				<div class="equation text-center">
					<span class="math">D<sup>+</sup> = (D<sup>T</sup>D)<sup>-1</sup>D<sup>T</sup></span>
				</div>
				and then solving the matrix equation:
				<div class="equation text-center">
					<span class="math">&alpha; = D<sup>+</sup>y</span>
				</div>
				for our weights, <span class="math">&alpha;</span>, where <span class="math">y</span> is the target image.
				</p></li>
